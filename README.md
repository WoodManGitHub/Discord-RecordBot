# Discord-RecordBot
Mixer by [Licson](https://github.com/licson0729)

Change this [repo](https://github.com/OKTW-Network/Discord-Recorder) from [Eris](https://github.com/abalabahaha/eris) to [Discord.JS](https://github.com/discordjs/discord.js).

## There are still some problems with this repo

1. After a period of operation, `Error [VOICE_USER_MISSING]: Couldn't resolve the user to create stream.`
2. Multi-track sound occasionally breaks.

## How to use
```
1. cd Discord-RecordBot
2. npm install
3. Edit config.json.example and rename it config.json.
4. npm run start
```

## Using optimized C++ implementation.
```
npm run installMixer
```
Default is JS implementation
